    <p>
      Software develeper with many passions. Having spent many of my early years
      simply not caring about accessibility until one day that I went to a park.
      The park was completely accessible with wheel chair capable
      merry-go-rounds to swings and zip-lines. I had an epiphany - not a single
      application I had ever worked on was accessible. I was literally
      preventing people from using applications I had built due to my ignorance.
